# Data-Analytics-Capstone
This folder contains the capstone project accomplished as part of SMU Academy Advance Data Analytics Course

This is jointly done by me and my team mate, Song Yi.

In this project, we explored the bicycle sharing data set from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/data) and uses machine learning models to help predict the bike sharing demand based on the weather condition on a given calendar date.

Explanation for each step performed can be found commented in the notebook.

Enjoy.
